　　笔者耳闻目睹一些大学校长在教师会上不是教育教师们监考要严格考场纪律，而是要放学生一马，以便学生能全部“按时”领到毕业证书。因此，全日制大学生考场最具有创新激情的就是“裙子下面的夹带”——老虎的屁股摸不得。
　　这个春天从开始就已经错乱，要么是因为梦境的诱惑，要么是因为现实的压力。情绪摇摆和动荡，象海底的水草。有时候我必须借助于酒精才能够睡眠。仍旧有梦，迷离，象一朵诡异的花。深夜里，只有呼吸还是清醒着的。
　　爱上笔墨，生觉得念，死觉得冢，这已经是我的信奉，于今静止。然而，当我的灵感慢慢消逝，当我不复穿越于山水碧水间，当我不复感知天然界的时髦得意，当我不复满月感触不复问秋问天问地，当我不复保护亲情的宝贵，不复用实情忠心抒写笔墨，我的情绪发端变得焦躁，变得江河日下，变得特殊烦躁。由于啊，我的作品，写了一篇又一篇，慢慢地，它不复被旁人承认，总有万万种声响，在品评我的笔墨。
Man is not the desire, a desire, will be lost is very simple, and we are in the whole world is filled with a confused the whole world.
On the way we pursue, it is full of confusion around pink tissue, by a has probably let's is a graveyard.
To is elaborate, let's get kung fu in case bold fall into, or when a remorseful.
When all open flowers on the branches, the tree of cherry red intoxicating.
I think the road of flowers, the flowers on the hill is also very unique.
I know on the side of the road not only wild cherry, and in the mountains, too.
There has been a cherry tree flowers side dam.
I still remember when our brothers to go to the mountain to play, they chose a lot.
Wild cherry is very attractive.
I can't help but get a in my mouth.
Unexpectedly, it is too hard to bite.
My brother know, this is not fit for human.
He smiled, he smiled and told me that is a bitter cherry.
Of course, they are very bitter.
I refuted his reasons for why they pick up back.
He ignored me, just gave his mother a cherry.
After the mother to wash, use cold water to immerse, add some brown sugar, after the night, she told we can eat cherry.
At that time, the sweet taste is already inside.
The bitter taste sweet and sour, and tastes good.
The soup was bitter and cold, special flavour is full-bodied.
Perhaps some people not used to, but for our rural children at that time, it is a rare delicacy.
